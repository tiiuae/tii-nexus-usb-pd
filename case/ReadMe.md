Files are made to be printed in SLS nylon for the Formlabs Fuse 1 printer. Tolerances may need to adjusted for other printers.

You will also need three M3 nuts and flat head M3 screws between 7-9 mm long (10mm will work if not tightened).

The intention behind the 7-segment caracters beside the output is to write down the selected PD voltage. Use whiteout for a dark material, or a marker for a lighter material. You can also use a chisel to remove the other segments, or remove them from the 3D model.
